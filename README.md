# Description

This is a small scraper in Python

Basically, it involves scraping bank websites or calling API (if any), parsing and finding the exchange rates, inserting them into the database and, after some manipulation, showing them to user. Of course, it stores exchange rates history for every bank.

# Technologies used:

* Python + Flask
* PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy
* BeautifulSoup & API

P.S. Needs adding try/except feature
